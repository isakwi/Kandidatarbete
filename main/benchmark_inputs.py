"""
This is meant to be a file to easily implement the benchmark. I don't know if this is how 
we want to do it, but then we can just remove the file // Albin

I added one step (p = 1) of the gates as they are defined in the paper (PHYS. REV. APPLIED 14, 034010 (2020))
I am unsure of how we define the angle for the Hadamard, I wrote 0 for now // Axel
